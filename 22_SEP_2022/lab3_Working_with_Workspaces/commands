WORKSPACE:

In Terraform CLI, workspaces are separate instances of state data that can be used from the same working directory. 
You can use workspaces to manage multiple non-overlapping groups of resources with the same configuration. Every initialized working directory has at least one workspace.
Terraform starts with a single workspace named "default". This workspace is special both because it is the default and also because it cannot ever be deleted.
